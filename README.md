Code Challenge Practice - Card

Use any image you’d like (unsplash.com has wonderful images)
Use a Google font that comes close to the mockup (it might not be exact)
The background color is dark gray
Use color picker tools to grab the colors you need from the png

Don’t forget to plan and ask any questions you might have before getting started! :)
